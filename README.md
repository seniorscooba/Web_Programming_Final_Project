# Web_Programming_Final_Project

This is our Fall 2023 CS546 Web Programming Final Project
We have created an application where users are free to log on and post
about hobbies and interest to engage with other users. Feel free to create
events and reserve your spot on their list. Make sure to also like and
comment on your friends posts to know you like their content!

To run:
All of the code is under the Code folder in this repo,
as long as you have the current working version installed 
feel free to initialize node and run node app.js in your terminal.
A seed file is also provided to prepopulate the data.
